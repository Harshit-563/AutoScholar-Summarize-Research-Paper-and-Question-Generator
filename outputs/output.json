  "summary": "in this paper , we present an algorithm for the automatic detection of clauses in a contract . <n> the algorithm is based on the following three steps : ( i ) the text of the contract , ( ii ) a clause detection algorithm , and ( iii ) an identification algorithm . in the first step , <n> we introduce a text - based algorithm that detects the clauses in the contract and identifies the clauses that are not in agreement with the law . for this purpose <n> , the text is first filtered through a set of clauses , then filtered through the set of all other clauses . at the end , a list of all clauses is generated , which is then passed to the detection algorithm that identifies the clause that is not in accordance with the laws of the law and the agreement between the parties . the second step is used for the identification of the clauses of the agreement . finally , for this reason , our detection algorithm is able to detect all clauses in an agreement , without the need for the users to provide any additional information .
