  "summary": "we propose a framework for the design and analysis of artificial intelligence ( ai ) systems . <n> the framework is based on the following three principles : ( i ) the ai system should be able to adapt to changes in the environment ; ( ii ) ai systems should have the ability to learn from and adapt to errors in existing systems ; and ( iii ) they should be capable of learning from and adapting to mistakes . we present a method for learning the time evolution of a sequence of random variables .",
